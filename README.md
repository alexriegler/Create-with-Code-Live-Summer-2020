## General Info
This repository contains some game prototypes that I created while I was learning how to use Unity. Each game uses assets from Unity's [Create with Code Live](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code-live-summer-2020 "Create with Code Live - Summer 2020 - Unity Learn") resource. I wanted to learn Unity since it's commonly used in the professional game development industry and the skills learned with it can be applied to game development in general.

### Prototypes
1. [Drag Race](./Prototype%201)
2. [If You Feed a Fox a Fruit](./Prototype%202)
3. [Street Runner](./Prototype%203)

## Technologies
* [Unity 2018.4](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases "LTS Releases - Unity")
* C# 4.0

## Setup
### How to play the games
To play the games, web links are provided in their respective folders for convenience.

### How to work with the Unity projects
To work with the source code, you must first have Unity installed. For best results, you should have [Unity 2018.4](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases "LTS Releases - Unity") installed. You may use other versions of Unity but you may encounter errors with the assets or code. After installing Unity, use your terminal to navigate to the folder on your computer where you want to download the repository to. Then, use the following git command,

`$ git clone https://github.com/alexriegler/Create-with-Code-Live-Summer-2020.git`

The repository should then be downloaded to your computer. From there you can navigate to each of the prototypes within the repository. The prototypes can be found in their respective folders following the naming scheme below,

`/Create-with-Code-Live-Summer-2020/Prototype #`

Where `#` is replaced with the prototype number, e.g., `1` or `2`. These are the Unity project folders. You are free to do whatever you want with them.
