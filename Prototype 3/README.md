## General Info
The [third week of the course](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/week-3-sound-and-effects-jul-27-jul-31?uv=2018.4&courseId=5ed163d8edbc2a0969cd1ded "Week 3 - Sound and Effects: Jul 27 - Jul 31 | Unity Learn") focused on sounds, particles, and animations. We were tasked with creating a prototype game from assets provided by Unity. The game at a minimum was supposed to be a side scroller with the ability to jump. There were also some challenges which included spawning random obstacles, adding a double jump along with tall obstacles, adding a super speed ability, tracking score, and adding a walk in animation. I implemented all of these features in my game along with some additional features and modifications.

## Screenshots
